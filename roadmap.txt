Project Planning and Requirements Gathering:

    Clearly define the target audience and the age group of the children who will be participating in the maze game.
    Identify the key features and functionalities of the maze game, such as game mechanics, difficulty levels, and user interactions.
    Determine the database requirements and the information that needs to be stored for each player.

Game Design and Development:

    Design the maze structure and create different levels based on the target age group's capabilities.
    Implement user-friendly controls and a simple interface to make it accessible for younger children.
    Include engaging graphics and animations to make the game visually appealing and enjoyable for the players.

Database Implementation:

    Choose a suitable database management system that is appropriate for the games requirements and development environment.
    Design the database schema to store player information, such as player names, scores, and completion times.
    Set up the necessary tables and define the appropriate data types for each field.

Data Integration and Storage:

    Develop the functionality to capture and store player information in the database during and after each gameplay session.
    Implement data validation and error handling to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent.
    Secure the data storage to protect the players' information and prevent unauthorized access.

Real-Time Leaderboard Display:

    Create a real-time leaderboard that fetches and displays the top scores and completion times from the database.
    Implement an automatic refresh mechanism to update the leaderboard at regular intervals, providing the most recent information to the players.
    Ensure that the leaderboard is easy to read and understand, especially for younger children, by using clear and visually appealing UI elements.

Testing:

    Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs, errors, or inconsistencies in the game and the database functionality.
    Verify that the game runs smoothly on different devices and platforms to ensure a consistent user experience for all players.
    Obtain feedback from potential users, including both students and teachers, to make necessary improvements before the final release.

Deployment and Maintenance:

    Deploy the game and the database on a suitable hosting platform or server that can handle the expected traffic and data storage requirements.
    Establish a maintenance plan to regularly update and improve the game, fix any issues, and address any feedback or suggestions from the users and stakeholders.

Training and Support:

    Provide training sessions for teachers and staff members to ensure they understand how to use and manage the game effectively in the classroom.
    Offer continuous support to address any technical issues or questions that may arise during the gameplay or while accessing the real-time leaderboard.
    Allow teachers to become comfortable with the game to push the idea that all s1's should try it and be active to gain the top 3 places.

Evaluation and Future Enhancements:

    Evaluate the overall success of the project based on the feedback from users and stakeholders, as well as the game's performance and usage statistics.
    Plan future enhancements and updates to add new features, improve gameplay, and incorporate any additional functionalities suggested by the users and stakeholders.
